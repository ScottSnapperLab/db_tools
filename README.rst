Install for Development
-----------------------

#. Install and become familiar with `conda/Anaconda <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html>`_.
#. Fork the repository to your github by clicking `here <https://github.com/xguse/table_enforcer#fork-destination-box>`_.
#. Clone your forked repo to your dev computer: ``git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/table_enforcer.git``.
#. Enter your freshly cloned Database Tools directory: ``cd db_tools``.
#. Run ``make help`` to see most of the ``make`` targets available.
#. Running ``make install``. This creates and registers a ``conda`` environment named db_tools. Into that conda environment, it installs all of the needed libraries to run and develop Database Tools.
#. To uninstall your dev environment just run ``make uninstall-conda-env``. All traces of the environment should be erased.
#. Remember to activate the ``conda`` env before you try to use or interact with Database Tools or you will not have access to it.
